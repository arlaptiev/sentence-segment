 "Jubal did not hear of Digby's disappearance when it was announced, and, when he did, while he had a fleeting suspicion, he dismissed it if Mike had had a finger in it, he had gotten away with it -- and what happened to supreme bishops worried Jubal not at all as long as he wasn't bothered",

 'Hal Yarrow was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out he had to study the recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen, Siddo',
 'And, from the first, he faced a difficult task the expedition that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo words with an equal number of American words',
 'Yet, if he used all of the little means at his disposal, he would be instructing his students wrongly moreover, even getting this across would be difficult',
 "For one thing, the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed somewhat from Earthmen's the sounds made by these organs were, therefore, dissimilar",
 'Plus the fact that Siddo not only had the normal ( to Earthmen) three genders of masculine, feminine, and neuter, but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual fortunately, gender was inflected, though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo',
 'What Gabriel was being asked to do now, however, was to re-examine all his basic assumptions, make value-judgments on them, and give them new and different powers in his mind to govern his motives this is not wholly a reasoning process -- a computer cannot do it all -- and even in an Angel it takes time',
 'of curiosity of a more alive time',
 "What Gabriel was asking was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments, and contract to let the Angels serve on Earth as it is in Heaven regardless of the applicable Earth laws the Angels in turn would exercise similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures of the Earthmen -- but they had no faintest notion of man's perverse habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own preferences and violations of his nature",
 "And it might be, considering the uncomfortable custom the Angels had of thinking of everything in terms of absolutes, that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war furthermore, even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of Jack's total make-up could not understand how the principle could ever be codified",
 'Almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward suspicion, not trust, as the safest and sanest attitude toward all outsiders yet there was some precedent for it',
 "The history of disarmament agreements, for instance, had been unreassuringly dismal but the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban, and a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on this limited question",
 'Out of that agreement, though not by any easy road, eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the United Nations suspicion between member states still existed, but it was of about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry between Arizona and California over water supplies',

 'Secretary Hart had taught Jack, at least partially, to be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters but there was no small way to handle this one',

 'Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and thought, the camp is quiet the Earthmen made camp outside the spaceship',

 'His body processes only slowed down enough for him to dispell fatigue poisons occasionally he fell into a waking, gritty-eyed stupor',

 'Not so obvious to her, but of more importance to her teachers, Helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid she would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction',
 'By relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity well into the frontal sinuses, she could direct the vowel sounds into the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat microphone she compared the results with tape recordings of modern singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar quality about them, not at all unharmonious, merely unique',

 'He endured the ministrations of the dromozoa without screams or movement the agonies of nerves and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near him, but meant nothing',
 'He watched his own body with remote, casual interest the Lady Da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him',
 'The dromozoa fed him in their mysterious way the drug canceled out his needs for cycles of the body',
 'At last he noticed a return of the inwardness of pain the pains themselves had not changed',
 'He tried to ask the Lady Da how long they had had the drug, and how much longer they would have to wait before they had it again she smiled at him with benign, remote happiness',
 'apparently her many torsos, stretched out along the ground, had a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body she meant him well, but was in no condition for articulate speech',
 "Once again B'dikkat moved among them like a father once again they clustered like children",
 "When B'dikkat cut the head from Mercer's thigh, he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage which held the head to his own body he saw the child-face grimace as the head was cut",
 'She found this immensely comforting, even though Mercer did not make much sense out of it thus events occurred, and victims changed in appearance, and new ones arrived',
 "Sometimes B'dikkat took the new ones, resting in the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains, in a ground-truck to be added to other herds the bodies in the truck threshed and bawled without human speech when the dromozoa struck them",
 "B'dikkat grudgingly agreed, but he did not come out of the doorway he spoke through the public address box built into the cabin, and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain, so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their happiness and wondered what their friend B'dikkat might be wanting to tell them",
 'Sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across the plain to the herd of men those who could talk declared it to be the breathing of Captain Alvarez',
 'But all of this was rationalization sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of Ann, and then could not get back to sleep',
 'The best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work he found that if he was tired enough at night, he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake',
 'They crawled through the north fence and came on toward him, and now he saw that both were young, not more than nineteen or twenty they were dirty, their clothes were torn, and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door',
 'She lay there, making no effort to get back on her feet the boy came on to the porch and sat down, his gaze on Morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring',
 "Morgan hesitated, thinking that if this was a trick, it was a good one he didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending",
 "Her eyes were glazed as if she didn't hear or even see him she had reached a point at which she didn't even care how she looked",
 'No girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him besides, she had a sweet face that attracted him',
 'They might kill him in his sleep, thinking there was money in the house he dismissed the possibility at once',

 'He caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen she sat down at the table, shaking her head',
 "I have to think about it but California is where we're goin '",
 "The silence oppressed him, made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through the darkness in its slow search they passed ranches that were framed dark gray against the black hills",
 'The wan light spread over the ground and the valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences and palely shadowed gullies they had been seen as soon as they left the ranch, picked out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless shelter of the trees',
 "The two men whipped their horses into town and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon, crying their intelligence the men in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's drinking, their faces red and baggy",
 'But the liquor had flushed their courage they greeted the news angrily, as though they had been cheated of purpose',
 'Lester heard their muttering, saw their eyes reveal their desire he worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his cheek and his voice came out of his throat, dry and cracked',
 "First he thought of the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being rustled at the far end of the valley he remembered Gavin's smirk, his own cringing feeling, his impotence",
 "He wouldn't even dance with her at Gavin's party he treats her like she was dirt",
 "And you stand by like a fool and let him do it  he remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water",
 "The mare began to tire and Clayton felt the spray of snow from the hoofs of Gavin's stallion he looked over his shoulder at the thin dotting of pursuers",
 "They neither gained nor fell back he rode low on the mare's neck",
 'He did not look back he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoofs that fanned out across the prairie to the north',
 'A bayonet hung in a belt scabbard he was partially uniformed in a cavalry tunic and hat',
 'Mike stripped these from him and donned them he and Dean tied and gagged the man, using his belt and shirt for the purpose',
 'Dean turned from Susan and took Julia Fortune in his arms he kissed her also, and with deep tenderness',
 'She too began to weep he released her and joined Mike',
 'And using him, Mike McLish, as a sop to her pride he handed the bayonet to Dean and kept the pistol',
 'Mike passed through it and moved toward the dark mass of horses they were tethered, army style, on stable lines',
 'That touched off a total stampede he darted inside the stockade and freed the horses there',
 'These poured through the gate and joined the flight the animals thundered away into the moonlight, heading for the ridges',
 'He scuttled in shadow along the east wall of the stockade and then followed the south wall until he was at the rear of the two frame buildings he crouched there',
 'They had pistols in their hands they bawled questions that were not answered in the uproar',
 'Mike made a dash to the rear of the frame buildings he crawled beneath the two supply wagons which stood between the buildings and peered around a corner',
 'He shouldered the blanket again, backed off, and tossed the lantern with its open wick beneath the wagon he turned and raced across the parade ground toward the rock house',
 'The pony herd was the one flaw in our defense the Rees undoubtedly would try to cut down as many of the animals as possible',
 "Oso slept unconcernedly, his rifle cradled in his arms i didn't catch a wink",
 'Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Gray Eyes rushing at me with a knife it was a relief when they finally came',
 'His face was split by a vermilion streak, his eyes were pools of white jagged red and black medicine symbols covered his chest',
 'It had a red circle the circle came nearer and nearer',
 'What else he said was lost in the rattle of gunfire on all sides the Aricaras broke under the devastating fire, wheeled and retreated',
 'A rifle cracked the square head fell over',
 'There was a ragged volley he was dead before he hit the ground',
 'The sharp cries at the end of the valley were faint they grew louder as the Indians charged again',
 'This time he delayed so long that some of the engages shouted frantically, but they held their fire the horses were only several lengths away when he fired',
 'Above me a dark rider was whipping his pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bales although my shot killed his horse, he rolled off the bale on top of me',
 'The Aricaras made one last desperate charge it was pitiful to see the thin ranks of warriors, old and young, wheeling and twisting their ponies frantically from side to side only to be tumbled bleeding from their saddles by the relentless slam, slam of the cruelly efficient Hawkinses',
 'In the distance we could hear the drums and the wail of the death song she was carrying a quirt, and she started to raise it, then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist',
 'An hour before, with the children asleep and nothing but the strange darkness, he would have appreciated company she had helped him change his mind',
 "That fire's too big let it burn down",
 "She showed her surprise by tightening the reins and moving the gelding around so that she could get a better look at his face it didn't seem to tell her anything",
 'She glanced around the clearing, taking in the wagon and the load of supplies and trappings scattered over the ground, the two kids, the whiteface bull that was chewing its cud just within the far reaches of the firelight she studied it for a long time',
 'He stood watching the girl, wondering what was coming next she had picked up the quirt and was twirling it around her wrist and smiling at him',
 "And it doesn't make any difference he sold me a clear title",
 "It was meant to insult him, and didn't quite succeed he took the reins just below the bit and held them firmly, and it was his turn to smile now",
 'She came down against him, and he tried to break her fall he grabbed her by the shoulders and went down on one knee, taking her weight so that some of the wind was driven out of him',
 'But a moment later he brought his horse forward into the light, and Wilson had a good look at him he was tall and dark-skinned, a half-breed, Wilson thought',
 'The half-breed eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap the scar looked pure white in the half-darkness',
 'The girl tapped the quirt impatiently against her knee and glared at him he took it without flinching',
 "Mine it must have got there when you fell against me '",
 'She brought up her free hand to hit him, but this time he was quicker he side-stepped her blow and she fell, stumbling against the gelding',
 'And determined not to show it they lay a little too stiffly, with their eyes straining to stay closed',
 'Not tonight, at any rate he had a feeling that the girl meant trouble',
 'If she did, he could stand it better in the light he scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans and reflected on how things had turned out',
 'Not all of it there would still be plenty of moments of regret and sadness and guilty relief',
 "The place had been cheap -- just the little he had left after Amelia's burial -- and it would serve its purpose there was only one place where Jake Carwood's description had gone badly awry: the peace and quiet",
 'He finished with the team and filled his pipe and stood looking about him he had spent two hours riding around the ranch that morning, and in broad daylight it was even less inviting than Judith Pierce had made it seem',
 'There was an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of trees, fed by a half dozen springs that popped out of the ground above the hillside orchard yes, there was plenty of water, too much, and that was probably the trouble',
 'A red-tailed hawk flew in behind them and stayed there, watching for any snakes or rabbits that they might stir up from the side of the road it took them an hour before they came to the first houses of Kelseyville',
 'The town was about what Wilson expected: one main street with its rows of false-fronted buildings, a water tower, a few warehouses, a single hotel all dusty and sunbaked',
 'I went to the hall in the afternoons only, on these preliminary matters it was dark and, I sensed, very large',
 'The clerk paid them no attention this impressed me, until I realized how limited was his sphere of influence',
 'Baldness was attacking his pate he spoke to me in a gruff voice, an affectation which quite belied his personality',
 'He wore his white shirt open at the neck, revealing a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath it was obvious that he wished himself different from the sort of person he thought he was',
 'He made a show of rearranging my forms on the shelf he would pick up the ringing phone with studied negligence, then bark into it with gruff importance',
 'The presence of the two exhaust fans seemed to indicate that the hall could become crowded for air one afternoon, upon receiving permission and the necessary instructions from the clerk, I had visited the toilet adjoining the hall',
 'I kept circling the block hoping to see, from the street behind it, the rear of the hall but it was not a tall structure and other buildings concealed it',
 'As I had expected, he insisted that my visits to the hall would do nothing to further the process of my application meanwhile spring had passed well into summer',
 'Cigarette butts littered the floor the big fans were going, drawing from the large room the remnants of stale smoke which drifted about in pale strata underneath the ceiling',
 'I had felt the draft they were making while mounting the stairs the staircase itself seemed still to be echoing the heavy footfalls of many men',
 'I rapped my knuckles on the counter the director came to the door',
 'he looked dapper in a lightweight summer suit, brown silk tie and green-tinted soft collar he wore perforated, white-topped shoes',
 'He had looked over my forms and was impressed by what he had seen there indeed, my scholastic qualifications were such that he, a college graduate himself, must envy me them',
 'These questions did not surprise me i felt certain that the director, like the afternoon clerk, seldom moved beyond the counter, that the hall, to them, was a jungle, a dark and unwelcome place',
 'There were three other men within this prison whom Barton would have liked to liberate, but they were in other cell blocks there was no chance',
 'They moved slowly, toward the main gate, following the wall there was no moon',
 'Powers was covering the remaining guard the man half-reached for the cord of the alarm bell',
 'But ten years in prison had taught him realities they were in a fight, outweighed in both numbers and money',
 "Then Barton touched Carl Dill's arm and moved off, up the river bank he wanted a careful, uninterrupted report from Dill on the conditions in the valley",
 "He had been the auditor for the mining syndicate, and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the syndicate's money he had done time for the theft",
 'It was over an hour before their escape was discovered, but still the news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state it reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame',
 'He ran the change rooms he threw out the hi-graders',
 'Ten years ago they blew up some of our ditches it cost us a hundred thousand dollars and thirty days lost time to fix them',
 'As she drove, she thought about her plan it was really quite simple',
 'All of her movements were careful and methodical, partaking of the stealth of a criminal who has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime she locked the ignition, removed the keys, stepped out of the car and went into the house',
 'It was there that she would have to enact her renunciation, beg forgiveness perhaps it was insane, Pamela thought',
 'Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream but she was caught in it, and she faced the terrible possibility that, if it were a dream, it was one from which she might never awaken',
 'Facing the forest now, she who had not dared to enter it before, walked between two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction of the pool she remembered little of her previous journey there with Grace, and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission would enable her to accomplish it',
 'The forest was open and freely welcoming, extending an enchanted hand the ground was covered with soft pine needles and the slope was gentle',
 'No wonder Melissa responded so completely to its beckoning perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed',
 'The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now, and even the dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken her fear she regarded them as signs that she was nearing the glen she sought, and she was glad to at last be doing something positive in her unenunciated, undefined struggle with the mountain and its darkling inhabitants',
 'today, on the contrary, it seemed utterly reasonable she did not pause to consider what she would do if her plan should fail',
 'Red man or white man, pacifist or killer, the forest would accept them all -- knowing that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence knowing that its ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man',
 'Pamela shook her head she must not think about time',
 'Nevertheless, she continued to move upward she was sure she would reach the pool by climbing, and she clung to that belief despite the increasing number of obstacles',
 'For a moment, she could not catch her breath and then, her breath returning in short, frightened spasms, she lifted herself to her feet laboriously she started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her clothes',
 'Her arm bled slightly, and the offended skin cried out in pain she looked around',
 'She was bewildered she seemed to have come such a long distance -- too far for her destination which had wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees',
 'She stood quite still, trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn, a path to follow, a clue to guide her she was standing in a thick grove',
 'She had the feeling that, under the mouldering leaves, there would be the bodies of dead animals, quietly decaying and giving their soil back to the mountain the thought made Pamela shudder',
 'She already knew this unwholesome, chilling atmosphere that was somehow grotesquely alive it enclosed her clammy hands and twined around her ankles',
 'It crept into the open neck of her blouse and slid down her body, seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores of her skin it crawled across her breasts, suffocating the life in her nipples',
 'It circled her thighs, exploring with its icy tentacles it entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus, and its particles, spreading, creeping, crawling, joined themselves into steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached',
 'stifled her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps clutched her throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched together in the rigid fixture of her jaws',
 'She had to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain, depriving her of reason and sight but she did not know which way to go',
 'She had to move in some direction -- any direction that would take her away from this evil place she thrust forward through the shadows and the trees that resisted her and tried to fling her back',
 'Twigs cracked loudly under her feet bushes swished and scratched at her slacks',
 'Lips pursed mournfully, he stared down at its crazily sagging left side then he hunkered down on the heels of his handmade boots, peered into the orderly chaos of axle, shock absorber, and spring',
 'Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package if I could make myself feel the same wa',
 'She studied him hopefully, yearningly against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it was easy to confirm her analysis',
 'rather on the medium side neither was he very powerful of build',
 'And even with her limited knowledge of such things, she knew that the car could be repaired there sufficiently, at least, to get them back into town',
 'A wildcatter had to be prepared for almost any emergency he had to depend on himself, since he was invariably miles and hours away from others',

 'Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel he seemed very pleased with himself, as though some intricate scheme was working out exactly as he had planned',
 'Along with this self-satisfaction, however, Joyce sensed a growing tension it poured out of him like an electric current, a feeling that the muscles and nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action, and that that action would be all that he anticipated',
 'He had a legitimate reason for wearing it it was payday for Highlands, and he was packing a lot of money back into the oil fields',
 'He himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company, but that had nothing to do with him he was an honest man doing a hard job, and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable',
 'Lord slugged him in the stomach, so hard that the organ almost pressed against his spine then, as he doubled, gasping, vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten, Lord straightened him with an uppercut',
 "Fear-maddened, fleeing the lengthening shadow of death, he scrambled to his feet again he couldn't see",
 "He could not grasp that Lord had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago, and that his leaden arms were flailing at nothing but the air he hated them too much to understand -- the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that was Lord's world",
 'This, he was sure, was the way they would act laughing at a dying man, laughing as a man was beaten to death',
 'She wondered what had taken place in town, between him and his wife she wished that she could talk to her mother about it',
 'Not that her mother knew what had happened, but they could speculate upon it but her mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it, and say that it was none of her concern',
 'He held a cigarette in his right hand it was burning away, forgotten',
 'Those who had slickers donned them the others put on old coats or ducking jackets, whichever they carried behind their saddle cantles',
 'They were all good men it was dark early, because of the storm',
 'He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain he hardly noticed the blue-green flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder',
 'His face was stiff with anger when they let go of his arms he looked at each of them in turn, Brannon last of all',
 'He was uttering threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked the door they returned to the street, mounted their horses, rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street',
 'They trailed him across the wide hallway to the parlor, four roughly garbed and tough-looking men who probably had never before ventured into such a house they brought to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves, that of their own sweat, of campfire smoke, of horses and cattle',
 'And their arrival caught John Clayton and Charles Ansley off guard the author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing',
 "He hadn't even pretended to be farming his spread his land had never been plowed",
 'He had done his rustling openly and boasted about it he had received both first and second anonymous notices, and each time he had accused his neighbors of writing them',
 "He had cursed at them and threatened them he was a man, those neighbors testified later, who didn't have a friend in the world",
 'He had his chance the very next morning, for exactly the same thing happened again this time Lewis had his own rifle in his hands, and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off shot, then spent most of the day searching out the area',
 'The company herds were being raided less often, and cabins and soddies all over the range were standing deserted but there were other homesteaders who passed the Lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing, the work of one of his neighbors',
 'Ross had no intention of searching for the assassin he heaved the dead man onto the buckboard, yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast',
 "Houses of settlers who'd treated the company herds as a natural resource, free for the taking, were sitting empty, with weeds growing high in their yards the small half-heartedly tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle than farming were lying fallow",
 "Brenner continued to smile, but his eyes were cold he turned and looked around at the lobby as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed",
 'He could hear horses moving around inside, and nothing else there was no lock on the door, only an iron hook which he unfastened',
 "He found a match in his pocket and lit it there were two horses in the barn, a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin",
 'Curt wanted to get Jess alone, without interference from anyone, even as spineless a person as the store owner he studied the problem for a few seconds and thought of a means by which it might be solved',
 "I suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four, either one with blood all over it, Arbuckle's blood '",
 "Once more he lifted Jess's gun from its holster, only this time he tossed it into the stall with the frightened buckskin he dropped his own beside it",
 "It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet the tines broke off under Jess's twisting, and he swung the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out",
 "His aim was hurried so the pitchfork whistled over Curt's head",
 "By now Curt was seeing clearly again he stepped inside Jess's guard and landed two blows to the big man's belly, putting everything he had behind them",
 'What a spectacle he was, caked with dirt and sweat and blood, filthy as a pig and naked as an Indian, kissing the finest, the sweetest, the bravest, and absolutely the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world he released her reluctantly for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap',

 "Charles, also fifteen, was tall and skinny, scraggly, with straight black hair like an Indian's and sharp brown eyes he considered himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him",
 'They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls, Jack, in the middle of the line, gave an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawled backwards, sitting down hard, her dress flying over her head',
 "That should do it, he thought, because Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school work he had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him, but he couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities: the teacher probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school",
 "On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a young woman of remarkable beauty and poise she munched little ginger cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green, somewhat hypnotic eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot king snake wrapped around his bronze neck",

 "But he liked the smell of Delphine's perfume besides, her endearments and caresses in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple youth",
 'Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs, a despairing boyish shriek, and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase it was Dandy Brandon, clad only in a bloody loincloth, emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him',
 "Once again life went its serene way -- soirees, fox hunts, balls and dinners the excitement over Brandon's bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie's stock soared when she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital",
 'The manservant Devol and his mistress, Delphine Lalaurie, were pursuing a young girl -- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty -- across the front lawn of the Lalaurie mansion the girl was not more than 16',

 'it had a look of grim stark realism, resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold, instead of the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy Western city basking in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and resources the jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment offices, outside newspaper buildings, in parks, in relief lines, outside government agencies',
